# Light Bar FX
Light Bar FX enables any developer to easily hook up custom light bar colour animations in their projects.    No C++ is required to use this plugin, simply add our Light Bar FX Component to your player controller, create a Light Bar FX Animation Bank asset, add your desired animations to the bank e.g. take damage, ambient, cast spell, UI menu selection, the list is endless! ...finally just start them from either a Blueprint or C++ via the Light Bar FX Component.
